## Important Links and Resources

- **GitHub**: Create a GitHub account to complete Programming Assignments
- **Discord**: Join the [Course Discord Server](https://discord.gg/tzywKCNM2j) - set your nickname to something similar to your IRL name or your GitHub username
- **_Optional_** - **Textbook**: Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), 3rd Edition
- **_Optional_** - **Syllabot**: Open this [repository](https://github.com/wne-cs366-f25/syllabot.git) as a devContainer in VSCode or prefix your Claude chats with `tinyurl.com/cs366-syllabot`

## Repository Structure

- `/Exam1/` - Materials for algorithm analysis and divide & conquer
- `/Exam2/` - Materials for dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and basic graphs
- `/Exam3/` - Materials for advanced graphs, network flow, and NP-completeness

- Programming assignment are privately accessible on GitHub (PA0-PA6) through a template with starter code and test cases. There will be a Java version and a Python version for (PA1-PA6) posted; each Student must complete at least one version of the starter code for each PA and may change languages between PAs. Student's will not be able to begin the first assignment until the Instructor cross-posts their Discord nickname to GitHub Classroom the morning of August 28th.

## Programming

1. Each exam folder contains lesson materials organized by topic (once theyre posted by the Instructor usually morning of the lecture)
2. Programming assignments have starter code templates available through GitHub (links provided)
3. Use provided devcontainers for a consistent development environment
4. All code should be tested before submission
