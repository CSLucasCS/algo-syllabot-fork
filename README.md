Programming Assignments are biweekly and due on Thursday at 11:59 PM via GitHub. Starter code is provided in both Java and Python - you may choose either language and switch between assignments. Solutions posted the following Thursday.

#### Late Policy with Auto-Calculation

- **1 day late**: 90% of earned score
- **2 days late**: 80% of earned score
- **3 days late**: 70% of earned score
- **4 days late**: 60% of earned score
- **5 days late**: 50% of earned score

Lowest PA grade automatically dropped.

Grades will be posted to Kodiak with feedback available on GitHub within 2 weeks of the original assignment deadline. Exams grades will be posted ASAP.

## Appeals

To appeal a grade that you believe is erroneous, contact your
instructor by email and include the following information:

- Your full name.
- The course and section.
- The assignment, exam, or quiz in question.
- The question(s) or part that you are concerned about.
- A brief description of the problem and why you think the score is incorrect.

Appeals for a particular score must be made within 1 week of that score
being posted.

## Academic Integrity

All programming assignments must be your own work. You may:

- Discuss concepts with classmates
- Use Claude for understanding concepts
- Reference the textbook and course materials

You may NOT:

- Copy code from other students
- Use Claude to write complete solutions
- Submit work from previous semesters

## Student Accessibility Services

I am committed to creating a course that is inclusive in its design. If you encounter barriers, please let me know immediately so we can determine if there is a design adjustment that can be made. I am happy to consider creative solutions as long as they do not compromise the intent of the assessment or learning activity. If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you may also want to meet with Student Accessibility Services. The contact information is listed below:

Student Accessibility Services
Herman Hall, SAS Suite 105
Office Phone: 413-782-1258
Email: accessibility@wne.edu

Once I have a copy of your approved accommodations from SAS we can plan a time to connect to discuss your accommodation needs. In addition, if you are approved for exam accommodations, please consult with me at least two weeks before any scheduled exam date to confirm the testing arrangements.

## Informal Prerequisites

- **Programming experience** (preferably in Java or Python)

  - You've implemented an assignment using recursion before, completed a few methods/classes for homework but maybe never worked on a project without starter code. You can identify 'clean' code and have a concept of an 'efficient' implementation.

- **Discrete mathematics**

  - You've performed long-multiplication before, can recognize the summation symbol and know a few binary operators. You've solved a problem that used set notation, functions, or boolean logic. You've written your own or understood the explanation of a formal proof.

- **Basic data structures knowledge**

  - You know the difference between a stack and list, know a balanced binary search tree runs in O(log n) and can order constant, linear, and exponential pseudocode algorithms.
